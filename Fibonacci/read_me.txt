This program prints the fibonacci series.

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, starting with the terms 0 and 1. The series can be represented by the following formula:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1

Here is an example of the first few terms of the Fibonacci series:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The Fibonacci series has many interesting properties and appears in various areas of mathematics and computer science. It has been studied for centuries and continues to be the subject of research and exploration today.s
