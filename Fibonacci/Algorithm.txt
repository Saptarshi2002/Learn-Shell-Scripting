Step 1: Start
Step 2: Take the length of serie to be printed from user
Step 3: Set a=0 (1st element of series)
Step 4: Set b=1(2nd element of series)
Step 5: Print a
Step 6: Print b
Step 7: While(n>2)
   7.1: Take c as sum of a and b;i.e;
            c=a+b 
   7.2: Print c
   7.3: Store value of b in a;i.e;
            a=b;
   7.4: Store value of c in b;i.e;
            b=c;
   7.5: Decrease the value of n by 1;i.e;
            n=n-1;
Step 8:Stop
