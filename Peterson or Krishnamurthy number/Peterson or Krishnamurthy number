We add the factorial of each digit and store it into another variable.
If the sum of the factorial of each digit is the same as the original number, the number is a Krishnamurthy number.
Let's take an example of Krishnamurthy number.

Number = 145  
= 1! + 4! + 5!  
= 1 + ( 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 )  
= 1 + 24 + 120  
= 145
