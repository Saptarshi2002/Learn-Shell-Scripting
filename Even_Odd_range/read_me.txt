This code helps to find even and odd numbers upto a given range

An odd number is an integer that is not evenly divisible by 2. It is a number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. For example, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 are all odd numbers.

An even number is an integer that is evenly divisible by 2. It is a number that leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. For example, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are all even numbers.

You can determine whether a number is odd or even by using the modulo operator (%). The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, the expression "5 % 2" would return 1, because 5 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1. The expression "6 % 2" would return 0, because 6 divided by 2 leaves no remainder.
