This code helps t0o find the sum of all the digits of a number

To find the sum of the digits of a number , you can use the following steps:

Initialize a variable to store the sum of the digits, and set it to zero.
Divide the number by 10 to get the remainder.
Add the remainder to the sum.
Set the number equal to the quotient obtained from dividing the number by 10.
Repeat steps 2-4 until the number is equal to zero.
For example, to find the sum of the digits of the number 12345:

Initialize a variable sum to zero.
Divide 12345 by 10 to get a remainder of 5 and a quotient of 1234.
Add 5 to the sum, giving us a sum of 5.
Set the number equal to 1234.
Divide 1234 by 10 to get a remainder of 4 and a quotient of 123.
Add 4 to the sum, giving us a sum of 9.
Set the number equal to 123.
Divide 123 by 10 to get a remainder of 3 and a quotient of 12.
Add 3 to the sum, giving us a sum of 12.
Set the number equal to 12.
Divide 12 by 10 to get a remainder of 2 and a quotient of 1.
Add 2 to the sum, giving us a sum of 14.
Set the number equal to 1.
Divide 1 by 10 to get a remainder of 1 and a quotient of 0.
Add 1 to the sum, giving us a sum of 15.
Set the number equal to 0.
The sum of the digits of 12345 is 15.
